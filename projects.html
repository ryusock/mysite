        <p>Some things I learned:
        <ul>
          <li>I was persuaded to do asynchronous HTTP GET requests to improve speeds (the fact that the synchronous request is deprecated on most browsers). However, it was a little annoying that I can't "return" the value of a request. Of course, I can just update a global variable in the callback function instead.</li>
          <li>Parsing the data proved to be more difficult than I imagined, too. I downloaded the data from Google Spreadsheets as a CSV file, so I figured I could just split rows by comma to get the array I wanted. Unfortunately, the city names contain commas and states, so it was not so simple. That, and entries formatted differently (I counted about 50 such examples) made parsing more challenging.</li>
          <li>When I finally mapped the data onto the chart, I noticed that the markers were loading slowly. <em>Very slowly.</em> They were loading one by one at about half a second intervals. With a table of more than 600 entries, that would take minutes, which is unacceptable. That's when I realized that looking up names by Google Maps is an exhaustive process. If I converted the location names to geocode (latitude, longitude), that would rapidly speed up the loading. Geocodes are great (and precise)!</li>
